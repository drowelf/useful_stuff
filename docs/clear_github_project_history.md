## How to nuke the history and end up with a **single-commit** branch still called **`main`**. 

### Preflight

```bash
# 0) Be on latest and clean
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull
git status  # should say "working tree clean"

# 1) Make a local backup of current main (easy rollback)
git branch backup-main main
# (Optional but safer) make a mirror backup outside the repo:
# git clone --mirror git@github.com:YOU/REPO.git REPO-backup.git
```

### Create a fresh, history-free commit

```bash
# 2) Create an orphan branch (no parents / no history)
git checkout --orphan clean-main

# 3) Stage and commit the current snapshot
# git add -A  # ** NOT A GOOD IDEA, OLD STUFF SHOULD ALREADY BE STAGED **
git commit -m "Initial public release"
```

### Replace **local** `main` with the clean history

```bash
# 4) Remove the old local main (we have backup-main if needed)
git branch -D main

# 5) Rename the clean branch to 'main'
git branch -m clean-main main
```

### Force-push to overwrite **remote** `main`

```bash
# 6) Push and replace origin/main with your single commit
git push -u origin main --force
```

Your repo now appears to have started today with one commit, and the branch name remains **`main`**.

### Optional cleanups / checks (do these right after)

* **Tags**: If you’ve ever pushed tags pointing to old commits, consider deleting them so they don’t expose old history:

  ```bash
  git tag            # inspect
  # delete locally
  git tag -d TAGNAME
  # delete on remote
  git push origin :refs/tags/TAGNAME
  ```
* **Other branches**: Delete any other branches (local/remote) that carry old history:

  ```bash
  git branch             # local
  git branch -D old-branch
  git push origin --delete old-branch
  ```
* **Secrets**: Rotate any credentials that have ever been committed. Assume they’re compromised once the repo goes public.
* **License & docs**: Add `LICENSE`, `README`, `SECURITY.md`, etc.
* **Make public**: On GitHub → Settings → **Change visibility** → Public.

If you paste your `git branch --all` output, I can tell you exactly which branches/tags you should delete (if any) before you flip the repo to public.
